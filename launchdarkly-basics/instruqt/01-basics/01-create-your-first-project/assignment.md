# Create a Project

A project is the top level of hierarchy in LaunchDarkly. The project will contain all of its own environments, flags, experiments, etc.

The first thing we need to do after logging in is to create a new project which we'll be working out of.

1. From the navigation menu on the left, click **Account Settings**
1. From the navigation menu at the top, click **Projects**
1. Click the **Create project** button located in the upper right-hand corner of the **Projects** panel
1. For **Name**, enter *LaunchDarkly Basics* (You'll notice the **Key** value is populated automatically. Please do not change this value)
1. Click **Create project**

Congratulations on creating your first project!
